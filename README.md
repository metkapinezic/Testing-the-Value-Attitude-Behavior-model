The value-attitude-behavior (VAB) model proposes a hierarchical relationship where personal values influence attitudes, which, in turn, shape behaviors. 
Both personal values and personality were shown to be important determinants of consumer attitude and behaviour.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the data collected for the study with 214 responses, from those 178 were considered valid, 36 were not finished and were therefore not considered in further analysis. Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency and dispersion, are employed to summarize and present key characteristics of the variables under investigation. Tests of sample data reliability were conducted with internal concistency test and factor analysis. Regression analysis was used to test the developed hypothesis and validity of the theoretical model.
The analysis provides insights into the reliability of constructs, underlying structure, and relationships between variables in the context of ride-sharing attitudes and behavior.

Building upon the comprehensive literature review and conceptual framework developed from theory of planned behavior and VAB model, I formulated and tested the following hypotheses to investigate the relationships between personal values and personality traits with attitude, intention and participation in ride-sharing:
-	Hypothesis 1: Personal Values influence attitude towards ride-sharing
    - H: 1.1: Self-enhacemen decreases attitude towards ride-sharing
    - H: 1.2: Opennes to change increases attitude towards ride-sharing
    - H: 1.3: Self-transcendence increases attitide towards ride-sharing 
    - H: 1.4: Conservation decreases attitude towards ride-sharing
-	Hypothesis 2: Personality traits influence attitude towards ride-sharing
    - H: 2.1: Opennes to experience increases attitude towards ride-sharing
    - H: 2.2: Extraversion increases attitude towards ride-sharing
    - H: 2.3: Honesty-humility increases attitude towards ride-sharing
-	Hypothesis 3: Attitude towards ride-sharing influences participation in ride-sharing

Overall, the research suggests that personal values and personality traits, play an important role in adoption of sharing economy services. 
It specifically confirms that self-transcendence values and openness to experience personality traits predicts a positive inclination towards ride-sharing. 
It can be suggested that individuals with values such as well-being and welfare of other people, justice and equality of others and nature, kindnes and generosity are more likely to have a positive attitude towards ride-sharing and therefore more likely to participate in ride-sharing services. It can also be suggested that open-minded, imaginative, and individuals open to new ideas and experiences are also more likely to have positive inclination towards ride-sharing and are therefore, through positive attitudes more likely to participate in ride-sharing services. Perhaps it is important to note that age also plays a significant role in predicting participation to participate in ride-sharing, suggesting that younger population is more likely to adopt sharing economy services.  


Statistically significant correlations between values and personality traits, attitude and behavior indicates the validity of the extended value-attitude-behaviour model. The developed model confirms that attitudes towards ride-sharing mediate the relationship between personal values and the intention to use ride-sharing, and that values and personality traits have both direct and indirect effects on attitudes and the intention to use ride-sharing.
In summary, the results offer valuable insights into the complex relationships between personal values, personality traits and ride-sharing behavior, confirming the validity of the VAB model and contributing to a more profound understanding of individual preferences and perceptions within the sharing economy.
