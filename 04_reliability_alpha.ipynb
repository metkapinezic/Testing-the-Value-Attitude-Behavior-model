    "Cronbach's alpha is a statistic used to measure the internal consistency reliability of a scale or a set of items designed to measure a latent construct.\n",
    "Cronbach's alpha, a measure of internal consistency reliability, can range from 0 to 1. Here's a general guideline for interpreting Cronbach's alpha values in terms of internal consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 to 0.5: Indicates poor internal consistency. Items in the scale are not highly correlated with each other. This range suggests that the items may not be measuring the same underlying construct reliably.\n",
    "0.5 to 0.7: Suggests moderate internal consistency. While there is some correlation among the items, it may not be strong enough to consider them highly reliable measures of the same construct.\n",
    "0.7 to 0.9: Indicates good internal consistency. Items in the scale are reasonably correlated with each other, suggesting that they measure the same underlying construct reliably.\n",
    "Above 0.9: Represents excellent internal consistency. Items in the scale are highly correlated with each other, indicating strong reliability in measuring the same construct."
